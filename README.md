# Discord Catalog

This is a website that allows to list discord bots.

---

## Developing process

First, we created the database for the bots and the
users who created these bots. 

Then, we built views to interact with this database
without going through the django panel.

Finally, we created a nice interface for the application.

## Limitations

This is the limitation of this version of this app
- Now, all people who can access to the app can update the database without verification and security
- User interface very old


## Possible extension

In the future, we can add some functionalities, like:
- A login account (so user need to connect to this account for integrate the database)
- More option to the bot (filters in the indexView)
- A better front-end
