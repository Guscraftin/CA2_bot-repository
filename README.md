# Discord Catalog

This is a website that allows to list discord bots.

---

## Developing process

### First step
First, we created the database. 

Then, we built views to interact with this database
without going through the django panel.

Finally, we created a nice interface for the application.

### Second step
We have added an application to manage the account.
Thanks to the account, you now have to log in to manage your
bots and to vote for all the bots. Therefore, in the list of
the home page, the bots are now sorted by the number of votes

Finally, we focused more on the front-end by adding a navbar
and styling the page notably with the buttons.


## Limitations

This is the limitation of this version of this app
- User interface is old


## Possible extension

In the future, we can add some functionalities, like:
- Buttons to choose how to sort the bot list in the home page
- A better front-end
- Add more testing to facilitate maintainability
